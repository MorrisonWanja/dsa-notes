<h1 align="center">Merge Sort</h1>

- The merge sort algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm. It works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
- With worst-case time complexity being ÎŸ(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms.

> How it works
- Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
  - Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
  - Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
