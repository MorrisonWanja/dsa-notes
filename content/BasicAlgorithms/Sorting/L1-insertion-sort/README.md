<h1 align="center">Insertion Sort</h1>

- To sort an array using insertion sort, we will iterate over an array and compare the current element with the element following it, if the element is smaller than the one following it, we will compare the elements before the current element and place the current element at the correct position.
- The time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2).
- The space complexity of insertion sort is O(1).
