<h1 align="center">Bubble Sort</h1>

- Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that is used to sort an array in ascending or descending order. It is a comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n^2) where n is the number of items.

<h2>How to perform bubble sort.</h2>

- Bubble sort is performed in the following way:

  - Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements.
  - If the first element is greater than the second element, they are swapped.
  - Now, compare the second and the third elements. Swap them if they are not in order.
  - The above process goes on until the last element.
  - The same process goes on for the remaining iterations. After each iteration, the largest element among the unsorted elements is placed at the end.
