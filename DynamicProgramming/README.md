<h1 align="center">DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING</h1>

- Dynammic Programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure (array, map,etc).
- It only works on problems with optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. An example of this is the Fibonacci sequence.
