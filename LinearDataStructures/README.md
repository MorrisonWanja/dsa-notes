<h1 align="center">Linear Data Structures</h1>

- Linear Data Structures are a variant of Data Structures that are used to store data in a sequential order, in this case, each element has a next element and a previous element excluding the first and last elements.
- Linear Data Structures have the following characteristics:
  - Sequential Storage - Linear data structures store elements in a sequential manner, meaning each element is stored one after the other in a linear order.
  - Single Level -  Elements are organized in a single level, meaning each element has only one predecessor and one successor, except for the first and last elements.
  - Fixed Size or Dynamic Size - Linear data structures can have fixed sizes where the number of elements they can hold is predetermined (e.g., arrays), or they can dynamically resize to accommodate varying numbers of elements (e.g., linked lists).
  - Access - Access to elements is typically sequential, meaning to access a specific element, you may need to traverse the structure from the beginning until reaching the desired element.
  - Traversal - Traversal through linear data structures involves visiting each element in a sequence, typically from the first to the last element.
  - Insertion and Deletion - Insertion and deletion operations in linear data structures may require shifting or rearranging elements, especially in fixed-size structures like arrays, which can be computationally expensive.
  - Memory Efficiency - Linear data structures can be more memory-efficient compared to non-linear data structures because they do not require additional pointers or references to other elements within the structure.
  - Implementation Complexity - Implementations of linear data structures vary in complexity, with some like arrays being simpler to implement while others like linked lists may require more complex handling of memory allocation and pointers.
  - Applications - Linear data structures find applications in various fields including computer science algorithms, data storage, and representation of linear sequences such as lists, queues, and stacks.

- arrays
- linked lists 
- stacks 
- queues.
